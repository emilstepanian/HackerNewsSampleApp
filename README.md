# Hacker News Sample App
This app is the results of a coding assignment given to me by a company in their job application process. 

The assignment looked as follows: 

Create a React Native app that displays 10 randomized Hacker News top stories using the Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API).  
The stories must be listed in ascending order based on the stories score.

The UI must include:

•	Story title  
•	Story URL  
•	Story timestamp  
•	Story score  
•	Author id  
•	Author karma score  

Hint: You’ll be needing the following endpoints:  
•	Top stories: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json   
•	Story item: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/${id}.json   
•	User: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/user/${id}.json   

Requirements:  
•	Use latest version of React Native  
•	Application must be written in TypeScript  

Bonus Points:  
•	Use Redux for state management
